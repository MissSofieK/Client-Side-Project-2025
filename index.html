                                They are not very tall yet, but they have lightning-fast
                                reflexes, legendary snack detectors and a mysterious
                                ability to open seventeen tabs at once without blinking.

                                “Mum, if the cloud is up there, why is all my homework
                                down here.” They negotiate like lawyers, calculate
                                screen-time like accountants and debug my life choices
                                faster than any compiler.

                                One legendary evening, I sat down to work on my
                                assignment for this very course. I opened my laptop,
                                whispered a prayer to the Internet gods and took a
                                heroic sip of coffee. At that exact moment, the
                                Bandwidth Bandits appeared, clutching the TV remote
                                like it was a royal scepter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Mum, can we watch something educational” they asked.
                                I should have known that “educational” was code for
                                “cartoons with dangerously catchy theme songs”.
                                Before I could react, the smart TV connected,
                                three tablets woke up and my laptop quietly panicked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Wi-Fi router started blinking in Morse code.
                                I am fluent in many things, but “help, your children are
                                streaming the entire universe in HD” is a new language.

                        <h2>The great household bandwidth treaty</h2>

                                The Internet slowed down so much that even my thoughts
                                were buffering. My assignment page loaded one div per
                                decade. Google looked at me like, “I am trying my best,
                                but your children are watching videos about baby goats
                                and asking me how tall a giraffe would be if it wore
                                high heels.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That was when the project manager in me woke up.
                                I did what every responsible mother and network
                                administrator would do. I called a family meeting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Together we designed our first official Household
                                Bandwidth Treaty. One episode for them, twenty focused
                                minutes for me. No secret streaming, no background
                                downloads, and absolutely no “I accidentally clicked
                                play on the entire series.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Somehow, it worked. The router stopped crying.
                                My laptop finally loaded this story.
                                And my girls discovered that Mum can code and still
                                laugh, even when the Wi-Fi icon looks like it is on its
                                last pixel.

                                So here I am, turning chaos into HTML and our family
                                story into a web page. I am still studying, still
                                parenting and still debugging life, but I would not
                                trade my two Bandwidth Bandits for the fastest fiber in
                                the world.

                                it is the invisible connection that holds us together,
                                even when the Wi-Fi goes down and everyone suddenly
                                remembers that board games exist.
